#scene 1 - 15 Years Before, Kai's House
    scene bg kai treehouse

    # [All black. sage.]
    # 1A ALL BLACK SAGE
    
    sage "When I was younger, I had three best friends."

    sage "We were tight. Really tight."

    sage "Our mothers were all best friends, so we got their permission to hang out as much as we wanted to."

    sage "Only God knows how many playdates we had. We hung out every single day after school."

    sage "Our favorite spot was Kai’s house, because he had a treehouse and his moms were incredibly kind."

    sage "It got harder to stay connected when we got into our high school years, because a lot of us moved away."

    sage "But in those younger years? It was golden."

    sage "And it turned out that we had more in common than we thought."

    sage "But I’ll let you see what happened for yourself."

    # 1B Treehouse
    # [Fade in with establishing shots of The Treehouse™. Sage and Kai]

    kai "Sage, Sage, guess what I found?" # amazed


    sage "A frog? Another bug? "

    kai "No, no, I found a gecko!"

    kai "I caught it outside! Isn’t it cool?"

    sage "Woah, Kai, that’s so amazing!" # amazed

    sage "Is it okay? It looks like it’s trying to run."

    kai "I think he wants to go back. I’ll let him do that in a second, though. "

    kai "I thought it was a new species until I realized it just didn't have a tail. Did you know they just ditch their tails to escape predators?"

    sage "That's so cool!"

    kai "Can you hold it? I wanna take some notes and you're always better with animals."

    sage "Okay!"

    "Further away, her other friends are playing a game of mercenary at the other end of the treehouse."

    "Sage always kept one eye open whenever she saw Jax playing with Tal. Tal started hanging out with the rest of the friend group a few months ago, but sometimes he'll get worked up and the air will feel charged, like a storm is brewing somewhere."

    tal "Okay, well, maybe you won this game, but you won’t win the next!"

    jax "We’ll see about that!"

    jax "My parents say that I’m really good at this game."

    jax "And I don’t like losing, so—"

    "Tal does an exaggerated frown and reaches out to playfully shove Jax backward, but the second he touches Jax, Jax jerks back as if shocked."

    "Tal scrambles back."

    jax "Ow! You just shocked me!"

    tal "Sorry. I'm so sorry." # (uh oh face))

    jax "Wait, wait, Tal. That wasn’t, like, the natural type of shock, right? That was you?"

    jax "That's so, so cool."

    jax "Tal, I want to show you something, because I can do something kinda like that, but you can’t tell anyone, okay?"

    tal "Okay… what is it?"

    "A small flame bursts to life in Jax’s palm."

    "Tal's eyes widen and instinctively he covers Jax's hand with his own."

    "The flame snuffs out."

    tal "Yo."

    jax "Bro."

    tal "Bro."

    jax "How did you just extinguish it?"

    tal "I don't know. I guess lightning is related to fire?"

    jax "We were so meant to be friends." #, grinning

    "Sage looks over at Kai, who’s still taking notes in his field notebook, his brow furrowed in concentration. "

    "She looks at Jax and Tal, who coincidentally look at you, and the two of them immediately look away."

    sage "I saw that."

    # next two dialogues in : normal sprite
    jax "What are you talking about?"

    tal "No you didn't. You didn't see anything."

    sage "…"

    jax "…"

    jax "You know what? I need to be home early today."

    tal "Me too."

    kai "What's going on? Wait, Jax. We have at least two more hours before you need to go home, what are you talking about?"

    sage "…"

    sage "You guys are so dumb. Here, I have something too."

    sage "brings the tiny gecko to her face and nudges it with the tip of her nose. Suddenly she sees into its mind, the steady pulse of its heartbeat."

    sage "It's good to see you."

    "The gecko stops trying to run away, and it seems to automatically cheer up, making a noise that seems almost pleased."

    "Sage turns to the others expectantly." 

    "She smiles. Her mother had always told her that most humans didn't have special powers, but seeing Jax and Tal’s abilities made her realize she wasn't isolated."

    jax "That's…that's something."

    tal "So, you can control animals or something?"

    sage "No, no, not control! I can talk to them."

    "Sage looks at Kai."
    
    "He seems wary and guarded."

    kai "Mine is water."

    sage "What?"

    kai "I can make it dance. "

    kai "I can’t do too much, but I can make it…"

    kai "flicks his finger, and the water in a half-filled paper cup sloshes over the rim. He squints at it, his hands clenching in his lap, and the cup tips over. "

    "The water seeps into the wooden floorboards."

    kai "That was a little lame."

    tal "Yeah, it was."

    jax "Tal, shut up. This is awesome."

    jax "You guys too?"

    sage "Yeah."

    kai "No one else is supposed to know."

    jax "Your parents told you to keep it a secret?"

    kai "Yeah. Yours too?"

    jax "Mhm."

    sage "We're not gonna tell anyone. Promise. And – our powers are weird anyway. It’s not like we're gonna change the world with an army of geckos or a puddle of water."

    kai "We might." # , musing

    sage "My parents taught me that magic isn't inside of any normal people. It’s just used to power lamps and stuff, not people. "

    sage "So no matter how special we are, we're weak. Like, according to science."

    tal "Fire powers aren't weak."

    jax "Guys, I feel like you’re really ignoring a big part of this."

    tal "What?"

    jax "Imagine what our pranks would be like. With all four of us, we can screw around with so many people-"

    sage "No."

    jax "But" # dismayed

    kai "No."

    jax "Okay."

    jax "But this is cool, isn't it? I thought I was the only one."

    kai "I still don't think…nevermind."

    sage "It'll be between us. Friends forever, right?"

    jax "Yeah. Yeah, let's shake on it."

    "The four of them shake on it."

    "After that day, the secret brought them together like an invisible thread. It was something cool that made them all feel special and, for years, their promise held true."
