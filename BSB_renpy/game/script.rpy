#scene 1 - 15 Years Before, Kai's House
    scene bg kai treehouse

    # [All black. sage.]
    # 1A ALL BLACK SAGE
    
    sage "When I was younger, I had three best friends."

    sage "We were tight. Really tight."

    sage "Our mothers were all best friends, so we got their permission to hang out as much as we wanted to."

    sage "Only God knows how many playdates we had. We hung out every single day after school."

    sage "Our favorite spot was Kai’s house, because he had a treehouse and his moms were incredibly kind."

    sage "It got harder to stay connected when we got into our high school years, because a lot of us moved away."

    sage "But in those younger years? It was golden."

    sage "And it turned out that we had more in common than we thought."

    sage "But I’ll let you see what happened for yourself."

    # 1B Treehouse
    # [Fade in with establishing shots of The Treehouse™. Sage and Kai]

    kai "Sage, Sage, guess what I found?" # amazed


    sage "A frog? Another bug? "

    kai "No, no, I found a gecko!"

    kai "I caught it outside! Isn’t it cool?"

    sage "Woah, Kai, that’s so amazing!" # amazed

    sage "Is it okay? It looks like it’s trying to run."

    kai "I think he wants to go back. I’ll let him do that in a second, though. "

    kai "I thought it was a new species until I realized it just didn't have a tail. Did you know they just ditch their tails to escape predators?"

    sage "That's so cool!"

    kai "Can you hold it? I wanna take some notes and you're always better with animals."

    sage "Okay!"

    "Further away, her other friends are playing a game of mercenary at the other end of the treehouse."

    "Sage always kept one eye open whenever she saw Jax playing with Tal. Tal started hanging out with the rest of the friend group a few months ago, but sometimes he'll get worked up and the air will feel charged, like a storm is brewing somewhere."

    tal "Okay, well, maybe you won this game, but you won’t win the next!"

    jax "We’ll see about that!"

    jax "My parents say that I’m really good at this game."

    jax "And I don’t like losing, so—"

    "Tal does an exaggerated frown and reaches out to playfully shove Jax backward, but the second he touches Jax, Jax jerks back as if shocked."

    "Tal scrambles back."

    jax "Ow! You just shocked me!"

    tal "Sorry. I'm so sorry." # (uh oh face))

    jax "Wait, wait, Tal. That wasn’t, like, the natural type of shock, right? That was you?"

    jax "That's so, so cool."

    jax "Tal, I want to show you something, because I can do something kinda like that, but you can’t tell anyone, okay?"

    tal "Okay… what is it?"

    "A small flame bursts to life in Jax’s palm."

    "Tal's eyes widen and instinctively he covers Jax's hand with his own."

    "The flame snuffs out."

    tal "Yo."

    jax "Bro."

    tal "Bro."

    jax "How did you just extinguish it?"

    tal "I don't know. I guess lightning is related to fire?"

    jax "We were so meant to be friends." #, grinning

    "Sage looks over at Kai, who’s still taking notes in his field notebook, his brow furrowed in concentration. "

    "She looks at Jax and Tal, who coincidentally look at you, and the two of them immediately look away."

    sage "I saw that."

    # next two dialogues in : normal sprite
    jax "What are you talking about?"

    tal "No you didn't. You didn't see anything."

    sage "…"

    jax "…"

    jax "You know what? I need to be home early today."

    tal "Me too."

    kai "What's going on? Wait, Jax. We have at least two more hours before you need to go home, what are you talking about?"

    sage "…"

    sage "You guys are so dumb. Here, I have something too."

    sage "brings the tiny gecko to her face and nudges it with the tip of her nose. Suddenly she sees into its mind, the steady pulse of its heartbeat."

    sage "It's good to see you."

    "The gecko stops trying to run away, and it seems to automatically cheer up, making a noise that seems almost pleased."

    "Sage turns to the others expectantly." 

    "She smiles. Her mother had always told her that most humans didn't have special powers, but seeing Jax and Tal’s abilities made her realize she wasn't isolated."

    jax "That's…that's something."

    tal "So, you can control animals or something?"

    sage "No, no, not control! I can talk to them."

    "Sage looks at Kai."
    
    "He seems wary and guarded."

    kai "Mine is water."

    sage "What?"

    kai "I can make it dance. "

    kai "I can’t do too much, but I can make it…"

    kai "flicks his finger, and the water in a half-filled paper cup sloshes over the rim. He squints at it, his hands clenching in his lap, and the cup tips over. "

    "The water seeps into the wooden floorboards."

    kai "That was a little lame."

    tal "Yeah, it was."

    jax "Tal, shut up. This is awesome."

    jax "You guys too?"

    sage "Yeah."

    kai "No one else is supposed to know."

    jax "Your parents told you to keep it a secret?"

    kai "Yeah. Yours too?"

    jax "Mhm."

    sage "We're not gonna tell anyone. Promise. And – our powers are weird anyway. It’s not like we're gonna change the world with an army of geckos or a puddle of water."

    kai "We might." # , musing

    sage "My parents taught me that magic isn't inside of any normal people. It’s just used to power lamps and stuff, not people. "

    sage "So no matter how special we are, we're weak. Like, according to science."

    tal "Fire powers aren't weak."

    jax "Guys, I feel like you’re really ignoring a big part of this."

    tal "What?"

    jax "Imagine what our pranks would be like. With all four of us, we can screw around with so many people-"

    sage "No."

    jax "But" # dismayed

    kai "No."

    jax "Okay."

    jax "But this is cool, isn't it? I thought I was the only one."

    kai "I still don't think…nevermind."

    sage "It'll be between us. Friends forever, right?"

    jax "Yeah. Yeah, let's shake on it."

    "The four of them shake on it."

    "After that day, the secret brought them together like an invisible thread. It was something cool that made them all feel special and, for years, their promise held true."

#scene 2 - sage's Car
    scene sage car

    #Inside a small apartment. Sage.

    "Sage groans and settles into a chair, opening the newspaper."

    sage "Here we go again."

    sage "God, it’s too early for this."

    sage "But I should probably get a gauge of what’s happening in the world before I head to work."

    #Image of one page of the newspaper, filling practically the whole page. It has the headline “NEW MAGICAL BOTS DEVELOPED BY NIKOLAI ZHAMONOV—IS THIS THE END OF LIFE AS WE KNOW IT?”

    sage "Huh. Interesting."

    sage "There’s been a lot of talk about how dangerous new technology can be…"

    sage "The talk’s been around for forever, though. Never thought it might actually come to fruition."

    "She flips the page."
    
    #Image of next page of the newspaper with the headline “LOCAL MAN ARRESTED FOR STRANGLING A GOOSE”

    sage "I’ll pretend I didn’t see that one."
 
    "She flips the page."

    #Image of the next page with fashion and outfits. Or something that’s easier to draw idk.

    "She flips past the next few pages."

    "Boring, boring, boring…"

    #Image of a newspaper with an old picture of Kai with the header “MAN FOUND WITH ELECTRICAL SHOCKS ON HIS BODY”. The photo is just an amalgamation of vague colors and it’s not clear yet

    "She stops flipping the page."

    sage "Wait…"

    "She looks closer."
    #Zoomed in image of Kai

    sage "Is that—"

    # A phone call rings.

    "The call is from her mother."

    "She picks up."

    sage "Hello?"

    mom "Hey, Sage."

    "Something in her voice sounds hesitant."

    sage "…Yeah?"

    mom "Okay, there’s been some news."

    mom "(God, I wish I could talk to you in person right now.)"

Mom: But there’s been a development. 

Narrator: Suddenly, dread creeps up her throat. 

Narrator: She picks up the newspaper again, raising it to read it—

Mom: Do you remember your childhood friends? The ones you always went to the treehouse with?

Narrator: Sage can’t seem to open her mouth to talk. She feels frozen in place.

Mom: Kai is dead.

Narrator: —and she sees the photo.

[Zoom in to the newspaper. Image of Kai smiling.]

Mom: I’m so sorry.

Mom: I know that—

Narrator: Sage hangs up.

Narrator: Anger builds and bubbles in her.

Sage: “Sorry”?

Sage: What the hell would “sorry” do now?

Sage: It wouldn’t fucking save him, that’s for sure.

Sage: My best friend for the first thirteen years of my life. He was there for more than half my existence.

Narrator: She closed her eyes.

Narrator: The world around her suddenly seemed too loud and unwieldy, and she wanted to rip the newspaper to shreds. She hated the photo of Kai and all of his happiness, his stupid grin and the way she will never see it again.

[Choice: “Read the rest of the newspaper” and “Go into action”]

[If “Read the rest of the newspaper”:]

Narrator: She skims the rest of the newspaper.

Narrator: “Twenty-one year old Kai Elsher died on May 24th. He had a peaceful death in the hospital, being tended to by a team of medical professionals. His medical costs were covered by his parents and an anonymous patron.”

Narrator: “He came to the hospital with electrical shocks spotting his entire body, unconscious. He never got to wake up.”

Sage: Electricity? 

Sage: But how?

Sage: I haven’t heard about it being used in ages.

Sage: Once magic replaced it, nobody saw a use for it anymore.

Narrator: She continues reading.

Narrator: “So, how did an outdated source of energy injure him in his last moments? This is a question experts are still pondering.”

Narrator: “Locals have been theorizing how he could’ve died.”

Narrator: “Sixty-two year old Paul Goodman says, ‘It’s one of those goddamn gangs. I’ve seen so much increased criminal activity around here. Just last Tuesday, I got robbed! I bet one of those wicked crooks are experimenting with electricity now.’”

Narrator: “Another local agrees, saying—”

Narrator: She closes the newspaper. 

Sage: …What? 

Sage: They’re making conspiracy theories on his death?

Sage: They don’t even know anything about him. They’ve never seen him in person, or heard him rant about types of worms in second grade. Nothing.

Sage: They don’t know about the treehouse.

Sage: Nothing! Absolutely nothing!

Narrator: Vaguely, Sage realizes that she’s shaking. She takes a breath, trying to calm herself down.

[If “Go into action”:]

Sage: And I…need to do something.

Sage: I need to act.

Sage: The police didn’t even know the way he died. 

Sage: When was the last time I saw Kai?

Sage: Or Jax or Tal? 

Sage: …

Sage: We have a group chat, but I don’t remember the last time I talked to them. 

Narrator: The realization hits her like a ton of bricks.

Sage: …God.

[Return to the menu with choices. Have to choose the other choice before continuing.]

[Options merge here]

Sage: And my friends…

Narrator: A sense of urgency hit her.

Sage: Oh my god, I need to see them. Now.

Sage: Even if it’s just making sure they’re still alive, I need to go. Just for today.

Sage: I’ll call in sick for work. I know I wrote their addresses down in a notebook somewhere; I just need to hope they haven’t moved houses since high school.

Narrator: Her eyes started getting watery, but she quickly wiped them away, sniffling. It didn’t matter what she felt at the moment.

Sage: I can’t let Tal and Jax do this alone. I have to…be there for them.
